Dear Instructor,

I wanted to inform you that I have decided to use MapTiler and Leaflet instead of Google Maps API for my project.
This is because I do not currently have a billing address or a card to set up billing for the Google Maps API.
I believe that MapTiler and Leaflet provide a suitable alternative for my project needs.

Thank you for your understanding.

Best regards
